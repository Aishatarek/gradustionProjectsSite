        <h1>What Should I Do After College?</h1>
        <h1>Guide to Post-Grad Life</h1>
        <p>So, you’ve graduated college—congratulations! That’s a huge achievement, but what now? After graduation, you
            may feel lost and confused, and that’s completely normal. There’s so much pressure to know exactly what you
            want to do after you graduate, but there’s nothing wrong with not knowing! We’re here to help you explore
            your options, from jobs to activities, and kick off this new chapter in your life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="divs">
        <h1>1.Take time off to relax</h1>
        <p>Use the lack of responsibilities to rest and recharge. Completing college is no easy task, and you deserve
            some me-time! Before signing on to that new job or moving to a new place, block out some time in your
            schedule to do absolutely nothing. Sleep in, rewatch all your favorite movies, binge a new TV show, or read
            a book.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Studies show that taking time off to mentally recharge improves mental stability and cognitive function,
                so a little relaxation can help you be the best version of yourself.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="divs">
        <h1>2.Spend some time at home to regroup</h1>
        <p>
            A stable environment can help you feel comfortable after graduating. Chances are, you’re feeling overwhelmed
            by the post-grad unknowns. Spending a little time at home is a great way to slowly ease into your new life
            and figure out what you want to do next
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reach out to old friends while you're home. It’s always nice to reconnect, and they may even be going
                through the same things you are.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="divs">
        <h1>3.Stick to a routine for a sense of normalcy</h1>
        <p>
            Make and follow a schedule to benefit your overall health. You’ve been following one schedule or another
            your whole life, so plan out your day like you were still in college—wake up at a certain time, block out
            hours for job hunting, got to the gym on specific days. Try writing out your schedule in a planner or
            filling in a digital calendar.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Believe it or not, sticking to a routine benefits your mental and physical health. Accomplishing things
                on your to-do list can feel rewarding, and getting up to move your body helps you feel good inside and
                out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make time in your schedule to hang out with friends, as socializing can help improve your mood and ease
                loneliness.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="divs">
        <h1>4.Start a new hobby to explore new interests</h1>
        <p>
            A hobby can help you find a new passion. Transitioning from college to adult life can be overwhelming at
            times, and a hobby can help ease your mind and let you explore new interests. Try diamond painting, reading,
            dancing, yoga, or playing a sport to keep your mind busy.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pick a hobby that interests you or revisit something you didn’t have time to do while in college.

        <h1>5.Pass the time and beef up your resume by volunteering</h1>
        <p>
            Helping out in your community is a great way to feel involved and part of something bigger. If you're unsure
            where you want to head next but want to gain practical experience, try volunteering at a library, soup
            kitchen, church, park, or even daycare. Ask around to see if anyone needs an extra set of hands.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Search for volunteer opportunities in the field you want to work in. For example, volunteering with a
                local elementary school might help you get your foot in the door when becoming a teacher.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sites like <a class="link" href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/" target="_blank"> VolunteerMatch</a>

        <h1>6.Send in a graduate school application</h1>
        <p>
            continue learning and become an expert in your desired field? Use the time after your undergraduate degree
            to look for and apply to graduate schools. Now that you have one degree out of the way, you can focus solely
            on the application requirements.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Graduate school isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay! Do a bit of research or talk to an advisor to see
                if earning a master’s degree would benefit you and/or your career path. For a degree like an MBA, it's
                better to wait until you have some relevant experience under your belt before you start applying.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check your college’s website to see if they have any graduate degree programs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Search online for your degree or career path with the words “graduate programs” to find programs all
                over the world. For example, if you want a master’s degree in publishing, you’d search “publishing
                graduate programs.

        <h1>7.Apply for an internship to kickstart your career</h1>
        <p>
            Internships help you ease into the workforce after college. If you have a firm idea of what you want to do
            with your degree or are weighing your options, consider applying for an internship to beef up your resume.
            Many entry-level jobs require experience outside of education. An internship can provide you with this
            experience and help you network. Search for internships near you using LinkedIn.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Not sure if an internship will benefit your career? Ask your college advisor, mentor, or career coach to
                see if they know of anyone in your desired field you can reach out to.
